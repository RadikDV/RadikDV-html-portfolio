<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Radim Dvořák. I am 31 years old. I've been interested in computers since I was a kid. I actively played games like Counter Strike, GTA, Fifa or World of tanks. In my free time I program.
  The reason why I decided to start programming is my interest in IT technologies and my desire to change my job.
